"91% of shoppers will switch brands because one is associated with a good cause" - National Retail Federation Big Show 2019

Parvenu helps stores raise more for charity and drive engagement through personalization. We've all been to the grocery store and were asked to donate at the checkout counter. That's great, but the problem is a lack of personalization keeps shoppers unengaged. Our platform asks a shopper buying dog food to give to the animal shelter, a shopper buying diapers to donate to a children's charity, and someone refilling their medicine to donate to research for a cure. Parvenu for Woocommerce is a free plugin that uses artificial intelligence to deliver personalized experiences for your shoppers by examining the item descriptions being added to your customers cart and use this information to recommend a particular charity organization.
